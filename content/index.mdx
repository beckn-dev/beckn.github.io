## Overview

Beckn Mobility is a set of open API specifications that work as a open application-layer protocol for integrated mobility. Beckn Protocol enables any consumer Application to connect to Mobility Service Providers (like Cab, Bus and Metro Services, EV Charging Stations, Parking Services, Tolls etc) through a Network of Gateways.

The network communication can established using the Beckn Protocol.

This page allows developers and architects to come together, develop and contribute software applications in mobility. These pages contain all the resources a developer needs to implement the Beckn Mobility ecosystem.
